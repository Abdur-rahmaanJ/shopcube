# Understand Shopyo

Shopyo internals explained here: [Shopyo: Enhance Your Flask by Exploring An Advanced Flask App](https://www.pythonmembers.club/2020/02/25/shopyo-enhance-your-flask-by-exploring-an-advanced-flask-app/)
  

# 📖 History

<details><summary><b>I want to learn!</b></summary>

Months ago, I was searching github for a point of sales solution that used Python. What bothered me was that many of the applications I found were not ideal. Some required Posgres with the expectation that a user would already have this installed, others had codebases that were a mess of spaghetti code, yet others were django-based accounting monsters ...

I decided to try making my own solution, modeled after a client request, I had once recived. I Made it flask-based with SQLalchemy and SQLite. You can instantly get started with no hassle, switching to something more powerful when you want to (since it uses an ORM)

For the UI, we used the latest, bootstrap4, fa5 and jq3. Interestingly enough, I had two shop owners try it and they were very impressed with the ease of use.

It is still in devolopment and supports instant lookup. Long story short, with some programming skills, you can solve some everyday problems. And yes, no cdn, all libs are bundled so that you can use it completely offline

# :construction: Developing a template.

<details><summary><b>Show me how</b></summary>

Each landing page and subsection should contain the following headers.


``{% extends "base/main_base.html" %}`` //  extends the base.html file.

``{% set active_page = "sectionName" %}`` // sets the active section (change section name).



#### Create the main landing page of a new section in the template folder.

Inside the template folder create a folder named as you want

```
/template
    /base
    /<changeme> (swap <changeme> for section name).
        index.html
```

#### Create a subsection template.

Inside the template folder create a new file under the folder named same as the section.

```
/template 
    /base
    /section_name
        index.html
        anotherfile.html 
```

#### Create navigation elements for a new section.


Inside the template folder create a file named ``nav.html``.

```
/template
    /base
    /example_section_name
        index.html
        nav.html
```

In the  ```nav.html```  file elements for the navigation can be created.


#### To display the navagation elements.

Open the template ``/base`` folder and locate the ``nav_base.html``.

In the ``nav_bar_log([])`` array. Enter the section name last in the list.


```python3
{% set nav_bar_log = [
  ('section0'),
  ('section1'),
  ('new_section')
  ] %}

Now enter a new elif statement containing a reference to the _nav.html

    {% if active_page == nav_bar_log[0] %}
      {% include "section0/nav.html" %}
      
    {% elif active_page == nav_bar_log[1] %}
      {% include "section1/nav.html" %}

    {% elif active_page == nav_bar_log[2] %} <- - - Add 1 to index.
      {% include "new_section/nav.html" %}
```

Then the navagation elements will be displayed in the new section.

# Roadmap

- ✔️ Models
- ✔️ Migrations
- ✔️ Restful Api
- ✔️ Manage.py
- ✔️ CSRF protection
- ✔️ Easy dev/production mode switch
- ✔️ Login
- ✔️ Api namespacing / apps

In Progress

- 🔃 Unit tests
- 🔃 Integration tests
- 🔃 Permission levels
- 🔃 Django-like structure (where models, views and templates all in one  folder)

Crossed Out

- ✖️ Forms (We believe it should be to the front-end designer's taste)
