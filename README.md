Featured on [Weekly Python issue 436](https://newsletry.com/Home/Python%20Weekly/9a578693-14ba-47c5-8a8e-08d7b0139fe7) üåü

# What?

Your back office. Use it with any front you like. Headless support coming soon. 

Use it for your next web project.

# Big??

Powered by apps / modules. Add as many as you like. 

Apps are not enough, organise them in boxes and get the ultimate order you need.

You need a customised Django? This is the project. You need to build an ERP? This is the project.

# Linux??

Hackable to the core. Even the dashboard is but a module.

Don't need our modules? Nuke them. Look boring? modify them

# Reliable?

We don't maintain middlewares. We rely on battle tested batteries like:

- flask_sqlalchemy
- flask_login & co

Heck remove them if you don't want. Want to use Peewee? You can.

# Rich Flask API

Common flask patterns are integrated, the structure is over the moon.

Common flask tasks are provided with an API: custom notifications, bulk form errors

# Back office feel & Theme

All looks are 100% customisable with themes ~ Backend, bootstrap included by default.

Again blow it up & use what you want. It's possible

# Transparent: Code your own web distro

Everything is clear, not hidden. You can 100% customise whatever you want.

We did not hardcode our choices. Our APIS are incremental. You can always use barebones.

# Plug & Play

The modules are put by copy paste. No blueprint codes to write. 

# Contribute

We follow a 100% first-timers friendly policy.
